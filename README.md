# Self-studying scraping webpages by using Scrapy
In this repository, I implemented scraping of the demo page using the “Scrapy” framework for scraping. Moreover, it was implemented so that scraping can be performed by executing a python file, instead of executing it from the command line.

# About Scrapy
